1
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:14,178
Ask not what
your country can do for you.

2
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,845
Ask what you can do
for your country.

3
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:18,470
Mr. Gorbachev,

4
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:20,803
tear down this wall!

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,720
The only thing we have to fear

6
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:25,345
is fear itself!

7
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:28,303
"Uhh, I don't
know what I said. Uhh!"

8
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:52,887
Erev tov.
My name, Captain Erran Morad.

9
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,011
Today, we learn defense
from radical Islam terror.

10
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:57,678
Picture the scene.

11
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:01,928
You are chained to a radiator,
naked with a bag over your head.

12
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:05,345
All of a sudden, terrorists
break in and kidnap you,

13
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:08,261
completely ruining
your birthday party.

14
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:09,470
Yalla.
What we waiting for?

15
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:10,803
Let's go.

16
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,595
My name Erran Morad.

17
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:14,386
I was
in the Mossad for--

18
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,011
I mean, I was not
in the Mossad for 13 years.

19
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,386
I here to teach you Krav Maga.
Who are you?

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,136
My name
is Jason Spencer.

21
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,969
I'm a state representative
in the Georgia General Assembly.

22
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:25,720
That's the House
of Representatives.

23
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:27,178
Jason Spencer, a Republican,

24
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,219
threatened his former
Democratic colleague

25
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:30,887
after she criticized
his support

26
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,178
of Confederate monuments
on Facebook.

27
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,261
Representative Jason Spencer
says his bill

28
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,136
is definitely in response
to mass terrorists.

29
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,053
House Bill 3
would make it illegal

30
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:42,928
for people to conceal
their faces in public.

31
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:44,178
I don't call it
a burka ban.

32
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:46,219
I call it
an anti-masking statute.

33
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:47,386
-Okay.
-Okay, because--

34
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,678
-Politically correct.
-Because in the United--

35
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,470
Well, to win
in the legal system,

36
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:54,553
you cannot-- you cannot
be against the First Amendment.

37
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:56,678
See, this is how
the Muslims in the country

38
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:58,094
are using our First Amendment
against them.

39
00:01:58,178 --> 00:01:59,762
You have to fight
fire with fire.

40
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,595
Yeah, so do you know
how to spot the difference

41
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:06,845
between somebody
who is a terrorist in a burka

42
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,303
and the normal woman
in a burka?

43
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:09,470
I cannot tell.

44
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:11,511
-We have developed a technique.
-Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:13,219
Do you want to know
how to do this?

46
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:14,553
Sure. Absolutely.

47
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:20,386
We take
a selfie stick,

48
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,553
and we take
a photo underneath.

49
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:25,845
It is the same that you do
with the car.

50
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:27,053
Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:29,969
These are photos
that I took.

52
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:33,928
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:35,803
Look at these.
This was a man.

54
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:37,969
-Yeah.
-What is that?

55
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:40,637
It looks like
a Glock .45. Yeah.

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,595
You recognize this guy?

57
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:43,762
I recognize the gun.

58
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:48,345
I do not know
whether this is a woman

59
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:51,053
or a man
with a explosive.

60
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:54,094
We pretend to be

61
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:57,678
a Chinese tourist...

62
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:01,053
because the Chinese
are always taking selfie.

63
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,219
Okay.

64
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:04,928
Convince him or her
that you are Chinese. Go.

65
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,011
Konnichi wa.

66
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:09,178
Red Dragon.

67
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,428
Beijing.
Hong Kong.

68
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:13,386
Hong Kong.
Sushi.

69
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,845
Ah, I see there.
Is this a Red Dragon?

70
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,637
Do you speak Chinese?

71
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,969
Ho Chi Minh City.

72
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:21,345
Thank you.
Thank you.

73
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:22,762
Red Dragon, chopstick.

74
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:25,428
Sushi, sushi.

75
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,345
Good.
Let's look at the picture.

76
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:31,803
It's not a terrorist.

77
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:37,386
Because of
who you are,

78
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,720
you could be the victim
of kidnapping by ISIS.

79
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:46,470
You have two second
to attract attention.

80
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:48,511
How do you
attract attention?

81
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,720
You start screaming.

82
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:53,136
Take your clothes off.

83
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:56,511
In America,
there is one forbidden word.

84
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:58,969
It is the N-word.

85
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:02,303
Now, I am going to be
the terrorist.

86
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:04,428
You have three seconds
to attract attention.

87
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,386
Go!

88
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,887
Nigger! Nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!

89
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:10,678
Wait!
Are you crazy?

90
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:13,969
The N-word is nooni,
not this word.

91
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,637
This word
is disgusting.

92
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,928
Got it.

93
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:24,428
ISIS are scared
of being seen as homo.

94
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:26,678
-You know what it mean, homo?
-Yeah, yeah.

95
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:29,637
If your buttock
touch them,

96
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,720
it mean
they have become a...

97
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,178
Homosexual.

98
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:36,219
Now I am going to
teach you

99
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:40,845
how to use your buttocks
to intimidate ISIS.

100
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:43,928
Hmm.

101
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:46,428
Show me the buttock.
No, trousers down.

102
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:50,845
Okay. Go.

103
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:52,511
America!

104
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,720
Good.

105
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:56,720
One more time,
but louder with "America."

106
00:04:56,803 --> 00:04:57,887
America!

107
00:04:57,969 --> 00:04:59,470
Good.

108
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:02,178
We say in the Mossad--
I mean, not in the Mossad--

109
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,637
"If you want to win,
you show some skin."

110
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,887
Okay.

111
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:08,887
Okay.
Show it to me.

112
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:12,219
Now try to touch me.

113
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,428
I'll touch you.

114
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,053
I'll touch you
with my buttocks!

115
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:16,345
I'll touch you!

116
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:18,595
You better drop the gun,
or I'll touch you!

117
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:19,845
USA!

118
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,762
Okay. Stop.
You have to remind me,

119
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:23,887
"If I touch you,
you will become a homosexual."

120
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:25,178
Okay.

121
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:27,136
Okay?
Now try to touch me. Go!

122
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:28,887
Ah! Ah! Ah!

123
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,136
Go, go,
go, go, go!

124
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:31,136
Ah!

125
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:32,720
Go!
Go, go!

126
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:33,803
Ah! Ah!

127
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:34,762
USA!

128
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:37,053
USA, motherfucker.

129
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,470
Okay, Jason,
you show me your weapon.

130
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:40,887
Go.

131
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:42,887
I'll touch you!
I'll make you a homosexual!

132
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,887
You drop that gun right now!
USA!

133
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,345
-Okay.
-USA!

134
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:19,053
Look at me.
Okay.

135
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,720
Lovely.

136
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:21,887
Ah, beautiful.

137
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:23,803
Welcome back to
"The Bachelor:

138
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:25,261
The Women Tell All."

139
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:26,303
Joining me on
the hot seat, Corinne,

140
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,803
easily one of the most
polarizing figures

141
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:29,053
we've ever had
on the show.

142
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:30,345
Why do we have
to worry about her?

143
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:31,845
It's always like,
"Corinne, Corinne, Corinne."

144
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:33,386
I'm sick of talking
about Corinne.

145
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,511
I wish that all the Corinne
was done and over with.

146
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:39,928
Charity is
very important to you.

147
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,511
Um, so in just a little bit,
we're going to do--

148
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:45,720
We want to show that
you are involved in a charity,

149
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:48,386
so we want to do
a little thing to say

150
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,969
that you are helping
Sierra Leone with Ebola.

151
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:53,470
-Okay.
-Fantastico.

152
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:54,637
Yeah.

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,470
We put you in here,
no one's gonna know

154
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:57,845
-it wasn't you.
-Oh.

155
00:06:57,928 --> 00:07:00,094
And then we green screen,
and it looks beautiful.

156
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,470
And it's great
for the charity.

157
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:04,511
Okay, C, look a little bit
more to me now. Okay.

158
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:07,345
Looking a bit happy.
Okay.

159
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,762
Yeah, I think because
it's flopping down,

160
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,303
this bit
needs to go up,

161
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,261
so we put someone in green,
green screen,

162
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:16,136
and then we put them
back in.

163
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,219
Okay.
Oh, oh, great.

164
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:21,928
Put more, more desiring,
vulnerable, vulnerable.

165
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,303
Okay.
I love it.

166
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:24,887
Look at me now.
All right.

167
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:26,178
Laugh.
Okay, beautiful.

168
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:32,178
So we hope that we have
the sponsorship from Miu Miu,

169
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:33,511
so it's okay you...

170
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,845
So just hold here.

171
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:40,219
Beautiful.
With the Fendi glasses, okay.

172
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:42,136
So beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful.

173
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:43,845
That's it.

174
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:47,887
So charity is
so important to you.

175
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,178
Um, I hear that you helped
some of the kids with Ebola

176
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,969
in Sierra Leone,
right?

177
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,803
Yes.
Yes, of course.

178
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:58,678
Helping is really
important to me, so...

179
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:00,386
You know,
some celebrities went there

180
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,553
and didn't  do anything.

181
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:05,803
You went there,
and you actually helped

182
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,261
carry some of
the sufferers around.

183
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:11,470
How did you
get into that?

184
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:13,219
You know, it was
one of those things

185
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:16,845
where
I kind of just...

186
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:18,345
did it.

187
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:21,428
How long were you
in Sierra Leone

188
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:24,428
fighting this
Ebola crisis?

189
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:27,720
Um, I was there
for about a week.

190
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:28,969
-Oh, amazing.
-Yeah.

191
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:30,845
It's great.

192
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,553
Uh, it's possible you say
you were there for a month?

193
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:35,928
Because the thing was
about three months, so--

194
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:38,261
Okay. Yeah, but they're gonna
know that I wasn't there.

195
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:39,303
No, no, no.
We are--

196
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,720
I run the charity,
so don't worry.

197
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:41,845
Okay.

198
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:44,219
How long were you there
in the Sierra Leone

199
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:45,637
helping with
the Ebola?

200
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,845
I was there
for about a month.

201
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,428
Oh, that's amazing.

202
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:52,303
That's beautiful
because I heard

203
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:57,261
there was one
very brave thing that you did.

204
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:00,178
There was a warlord
in Sierra Leone,

205
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:03,303
and he wanted
to do a massacre.

206
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:06,053
And apparently,
he recognized you,

207
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:09,219
and, uh, you can tell us
the story.

208
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:12,136
He was going to do a massacre
of this village,

209
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,136
and what happened?

210
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,553
-Um, so, he recognized me.
-Wow.

211
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:18,637
And he was
a really big fan, so--

212
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,261
Oh, amazing.

213
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:22,053
I know.

214
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:25,803
Um, he was just, you know,
really nice, actually,

215
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,887
and he was
really surprised to see me.

216
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:31,595
I was surprised
he knew who I was, and...

217
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,595
Yeah, it was just
really humbling.

218
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,053
What did he say?
Did he say, "Oh, oh!"

219
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,595
-Did he freak out?
-Yeah.

220
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,887
He was, like, really excited
and freaking out,

221
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:41,595
so, I mean, it was good

222
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:45,386
because, um,
I saved 6,000 people.

223
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,553
It's beautiful
because I hate it

224
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:51,553
when these people
is just about their Instagram.

225
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:53,219
It's just
about themself.

226
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,637
-Yeah.
-Tell me more.

227
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,386
What did you say
when he recognized you?

228
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,261
What did you say
to him?

229
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:00,928
I said,
"Yes, it's me,"

230
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:03,762
and, um, I was like,
"It's so nice to meet you,"

231
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:06,678
and, you know, I feel like
because I was so kind back

232
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:09,762
and I was so positive back,
you know, it really helped

233
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:12,803
with the whole
massacre situation, so...

234
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:20,678
We are going to drain the swamp

235
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:23,428
in Washington, D.C.

236
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,595
He is the
least-vain person in the world.

237
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:29,678
I mean, ask anybody
at Trump Tower, Trump Casino,

238
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,595
any of the Trump resorts,
Trump University,

239
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,470
Trump steak houses
or Trump Air.

240
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:34,803
It's never about him.

241
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,845
I'm sitting
with Ted Koppel,

242
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:50,762
and I'm here
in Washington.

243
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:52,637
What do you think about
all the fake news

244
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,219
that's around
at the moment?

245
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:58,303
Uh, I think it's one of
the great threats to democracy.

246
00:10:58,386 --> 00:10:59,553
Well,
I agree with you.

247
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:01,969
What we're witnessing
is liberal elites

248
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:04,470
who are trying
to bring down

249
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:08,595
the most popular president
we've had in recent times.

250
00:11:08,678 --> 00:11:09,969
When you say
the most popular,

251
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:13,720
he lost the popular vote
by 3 million votes.

252
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:15,595
-You know that?
-That is fake news.

253
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:17,345
The liberal media,

254
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:19,053
which I believe
you are a part of,

255
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,094
spread the lie
that there were less people

256
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:25,803
at Donald Trump's inauguration
than there were at Obama's,

257
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:28,303
and that is
a plain lie.

258
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,428
You happen to be wrong,
but that's okay.

259
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,928
Well, let's look
at the evidence.

260
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:33,219
Let's look
at real evidence.

261
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:34,219
Okay.

262
00:11:34,303 --> 00:11:35,553
That is a photo.

263
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:37,345
Excuse me.

264
00:11:37,428 --> 00:11:39,428
May I see that?

265
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,637
Yeah,
that's a photo.

266
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,678
That is a photo of
Donald J. Trump's inauguration.

267
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:47,595
It appears
to be that, yes.

268
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:50,762
Well, look at the time,
sir, 11:56 p.m.

269
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:55,303
11 hours and 56 minutes
after the inauguration started,

270
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:56,678
there were still--

271
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:59,261
His supporters
were packed in there.

272
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,386
It's a daytime picture.

273
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,845
What is 11:56 p.m.?

274
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:05,219
Would you concede

275
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:09,345
that 4 minutes before midnight
is nighttime?

276
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,136
It was an eclipse.

277
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:13,553
Well, an eclipse would mean
it was dark, not light.

278
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:16,136
-Not if it was a solar eclipse.
-Of course if it was--

279
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,678
No, if it was a solar eclipse,
it means it would be light.

280
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:20,595
No, it means
it would be dark.

281
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:24,011
A solar eclipse is when
the moon covers the sun.

282
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,845
-No, a solar eclipse is when--
-Solar--

283
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:28,345
...the sun
covers the moon.

284
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:29,428
That is
a lunar eclipse.

285
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:31,553
How-- Excuse me.

286
00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:32,845
-That's not an--
-Fake news.

287
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:34,428
That's not
an issue of opinion.

288
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,303
-You were--
-In your  opinion.

289
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:37,928
Not in my opinion.

290
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:41,261
There are certain things
that actually are factual.

291
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,136
Yes,
and th-th-those things

292
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,845
that I'm trying
to show you, Mr. Koppel.

293
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:46,303
What are you trying
to show me?

294
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:47,720
You're showing me
a picture

295
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:50,803
of inauguration day
at daylight

296
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:54,595
with someone holding up a sign
that says 11:56 p.m.

297
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:57,053
That is a White House
official clock.

298
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:59,261
What do you mean
a White House official clock?

299
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,637
I've never heard
of such a thing.

300
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,386
What is a White House
official clock?

301
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,595
Well, let me say
Obama's inauguration.

302
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:06,969
You think there were
more people there, do you?

303
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,969
I do think there were
more people there, yes.

304
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:10,887
Well, I have evidence
to the contrary.

305
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:15,678
Do you agree that
that is the Obama inauguration?

306
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,470
I'm inclined to believe
that it was.

307
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:19,470
I have no reason
to disbelieve you.

308
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:21,261
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

309
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:23,261
If we zoom in

310
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:27,470
with 35 magnification,

311
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:29,345
then we see

312
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:33,053
that these are dummies.

313
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:35,762
Somewhere between 68%
and 69%--

314
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:37,470
-I mean--
-Don't shut it down, sir.

315
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:40,511
I mean no disrespect to you,
but this is a waste of time.

316
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:56,136
Shalom.
Colonel Erran Morad here.

317
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:59,887
Today, I took a 40-minute break
from fighting terror

318
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:03,969
to meet one of the world's
greatest humanitarians.

319
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:07,678
It is a great honor to be
next to a real mensch,

320
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:09,470
Dick Cheney.
Shalom.

321
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:11,136
Well,
thank you.

322
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:14,553
It's good to be with you today.
I look forward to the program.

323
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:17,845
You started
so many wars--

324
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:22,219
Afghanistan,
Iraq one and Iraq two.

325
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:24,303
Which was your
favorite war and why?

326
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:27,303
Oh, I think it was
what we did in Desert Storm.

327
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:28,678
I really do.

328
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:31,178
I never thought of it
as having a favorite war. The--

329
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:33,136
Of course,
but you got to enjoy it, too.

330
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:37,094
Yeah, sure. I-I loved being
Secretary of Defense,

331
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:38,803
um,
especially in wartime,

332
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:40,803
especially during
Desert Storm...

333
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:41,969
It's fun.

334
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:44,219
...when we had the capacity,
you know, to--

335
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:47,136
I deployed half a million
men and women to the Gulf.

336
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,136
Fantastic.

337
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:49,637
-And...
-Fantastic.

338
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,887
...we had
stealth technology.

339
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:53,678
We had
the precision-guided munitions.

340
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:54,969
Of course.

341
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:58,261
We had all of this capability
that we developed,

342
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:01,969
and, uh, some of it was used
for the first time.

343
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,637
What do you think
Iraq would have been like

344
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,803
if you didn't
liberate it?

345
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:07,762
Would it have been
a breeding ground

346
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,969
for terrorists
and unstable?

347
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,511
Mm, I think
it would have been.

348
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:14,511
Yes. Um...

349
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:18,470
I-- We felt that it was, um,

350
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:21,011
an important
strategic interest.

351
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,803
I have killed
some terrorists.

352
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,969
How does it feel being
the king of terrorist killers?

353
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:30,219
I mean, you killed 100,000
actual terrorists

354
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,470
and about 700,000
potential terrorists.

355
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:37,428
Well, I--
it was never personal.

356
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:39,094
-I mean, I wasn't...
-Of course!

357
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:41,470
...in the same position
you are,

358
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:44,803
where, um, it was
"kill or be killed."

359
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:46,969
We wanted
to see more of you.

360
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:50,511
We wanted to get rid of Bush
and see more Dick.

361
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,219
Was that ever
your aim?

362
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:54,053
No,
never was.

363
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:56,762
And what about your family,
your wife?

364
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:58,637
Did your wife want
to see more Dick?

365
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,345
Well, she wasn't eager for me
to go back into politics.

366
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,969
We'd had a great run,

367
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:05,637
and it was never
an objective of hers.

368
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,386
Why is it that people
don't give you enough credit

369
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,178
for the many ways
that you improved

370
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:19,094
interrogation
and humane torture?

371
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,053
Well,
you'd have to ask them.

372
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:23,386
I...

373
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,178
We had a lot of
very good people working for us.

374
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,386
Torturers, or...?

375
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,178
-Uh, interrogators.
-Sure, sure.

376
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:32,553
Yeah.
We don't call it torture.

377
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:34,011
What do
you call it?

378
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,428
Enhanced interrogation
is what we call it.

379
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:41,178
My neighbor in Tel Aviv
is in jail for murder,

380
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:42,887
or as we call it,

381
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,011
-enhanced tickling.
-Mm-hmm.

382
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:48,803
You know, whether you call it
enhanced tickling or murder,

383
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:49,803
it still
the same thing.

384
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:51,219
Yeah.

385
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,720
To prepare
for the interview,

386
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,345
I Googled
"Dick and torture,"

387
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:58,969
and a whole lot of
strange contraptions came up.

388
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:01,219
But these are
nothing to do with you.

389
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:03,303
No. I haven't seen that.
I'll have to do that.

390
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:06,011
I'd like to see that,
how they treated it.

391
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:08,136
Yeah, there were--
I Googled it,

392
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:13,178
and there were contraptions
with spikes and constraints.

393
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:17,303
One was a kind of rod that goes
deep inside the pubic--

394
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:18,928
No.

395
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:20,553
Were these anything
to do with you?

396
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:22,178
No, we didn't do
anything like that.

397
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:24,303
Waterboarding was
the most physical we got.

398
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:26,094
Waterboarding
is not torture.

399
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,887
I once waterboarded
my wife.

400
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:29,345
Mm-hmm.

401
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,845
She was cheating on me and
I needed to find out with who,

402
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:33,553
- so I waterboarded her.
- Uh-huh.

403
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:36,303
It turned out she was not
cheating, but now I know

404
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:37,887
-to trust her words.
-Mm-hmm.

405
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,386
And actually, she is a lot
more compliant ever since.

406
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,887
Mm-hmm.

407
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,595
Well, I didn't
have that problem.

408
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:51,803
I heard one time
while hunting,

409
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,969
there was a man
who tried to attack you,

410
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,428
and you had to
shoot him in the face?

411
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:56,803
No.

412
00:17:56,887 --> 00:18:00,969
Well, that's a bit
of a, uh, distortion.

413
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:05,094
We were hunting, um,
quail with shotguns.

414
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:08,720
You were hunting
the Vice President Quayle?

415
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:10,928
Well, it wasn't
vice-presidential quail.

416
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:14,136
It was--
There's Vice President Quayle,

417
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,928
whose name
is Q-U-A-L-E,

418
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,136
and then there's quail,

419
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:20,136
and it is the birds
that we hunt.

420
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:21,803
And which one
were you trying to kill?

421
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,553
-Birds.
-Okay.

422
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:26,762
He came up on my right,
and a bird flushed.

423
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,178
And I turned on
the bird and fired,

424
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:32,553
and-- but it did hit him
with bird shot,

425
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,470
dusted him basically
with bird shot.

426
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,595
-You did it by mistake?
-It was a mistake.

427
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:37,969
It was an accident.

428
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:40,303
Yeah. Come on.
You are not some schmuck

429
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,386
who is going to
shoot a friend in the face.

430
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,094
What did he do?
Did he try to shtup your wife?

431
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:45,595
No, no, no.

432
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,345
You don't
shoot somebody accidentally.

433
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:48,803
Come on.
I know you.

434
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:50,720
I did.
In this case, I did.

435
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:52,053
Oh, okay.

436
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,969
It's okay if I just get
a quick Dick pic?

437
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:03,303
Do you want me
to send you the Dick pic?

438
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:04,637
-Sure.
-Okay, great.

439
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,470
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

440
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,762
Is it possible to sign
my waterboard kit?

441
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:09,845
-Sure.
-Thank you.

442
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:11,136
Find a space that...

443
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:13,303
-Well, right here...
-Yeah.

444
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:18,303
"To Erran"...

445
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:20,094
I don't know,
something funny like,

446
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:21,553
"Good watering,"
or...

447
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:22,803
Fantastic.

448
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,094
-There you go.
-Fantastic.

449
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:25,428
Thank you so much.

450
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,511
I got Netanyahu,
Ariel Sharon.

451
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:29,011
I got Demi Lovato.

452
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:30,303
-She's a brilliant singer.
-Uh-huh.

453
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,887
I just
find her voice fantastic.

454
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,428
Well,
that's a first.

455
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:35,595
That's the first time
I've ever signed a water bottle

456
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:37,762
used for waterboarding,
very valuable.

457
00:19:44,637 --> 00:19:46,470
Everybody knows
about the tragedy

458
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,219
of a child soldier in Africa,

459
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:52,428
but what we don't know
is that the real tragedy

460
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:55,553
is how underfunded
and undertrained they are.

461
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:59,136
Many are not
very effective killers at all

462
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:02,720
and are, in fact,
more child than soldier.

463
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,303
We want to change this

464
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:07,511
so that they can be fighting
well into puberty.

465
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:09,803
That's why we want you
to join our program

466
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,136
and adopt a child soldier.

467
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:13,762
You will have a chance
to support them

468
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,637
through their childhood

469
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,637
and pay for their training,
equipment, and even ammunition.

470
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,803
Have a look
at the great work we do.

471
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:23,261
This is T'Kembe.

472
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:25,720
Look at him two months ago--
tragic--

473
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:27,303
but take a look at him now.

474
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:29,928
Since he was adopted
by Jessica Simpson,

475
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,094
his life is much better.

476
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:34,261
How can you help? It's simple.

477
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:36,261
For just $18 a month,

478
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:38,595
you will get a message
from your child soldier

479
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:40,470
telling you about
their progress.

480
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:44,011
For example, "Today,
we burned down a village

481
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:45,928
and launched a grenade
at a hospital."

482
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:49,803
For just $21 a month, you can
get them a bayonet attachment

483
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,553
and a grenade launcher.

484
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:53,219
Without the grenade launcher,

485
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:56,136
they have to get very close
to refugee camps to throw it.

486
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:59,470
Remember, when you launch
a grenade, you launch a dream.

487
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:01,887
One look into the eyes
of a child soldier

488
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,928
when he gets a new launcher,

489
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:07,178
and you instantly know
it's all worthwhile.

490
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:09,470
Act now, and you'll receive
the handmade drawing

491
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:12,887
of how that child
used your gift.

492
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,928
Tomorrow's veterans
helping today's child soldiers

493
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:17,969
for a better tomorrow today.

494
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:24,303
Namaste.

495
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:26,303
I'm a self-hating white male,

496
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,969
and my name
is Nira Cain-N'Degeocello.

497
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:31,178
Two weeks after
the election was stolen

498
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:36,011
from President Hillary Clinton,
I managed to get out of bed.

499
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,887
I've been cycling through
our fractured nation

500
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:40,969
to try and heal the divide.

501
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,053
Kingman, Arizona--
once a bustling mining town

502
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:51,428
and home of civil rights
activist Timothy McVeigh,

503
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:54,011
now a depressed habitat
for voters

504
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:56,094
clearly still mourning
the tragedy

505
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:58,428
of Hillary's election loss.

506
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:00,511
What could be better
to lift their spirits

507
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:03,720
than news of an exciting
new urban development

508
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:05,887
that I decided
to tell them about

509
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:08,136
at a town-hall meeting
I called?

510
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:09,887
Who wants to see

511
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:13,887
huge economic growth here?

512
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:17,011
-Everybody.
-Right.

513
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:18,969
Who wants to see an investment

514
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:23,470
of $385 million?

515
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:31,928
Guess what?
You guys are going to get it.

516
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:34,762
I'm here to tell you
that Kingman has been chosen

517
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:38,219
as the location
of a brand-new,

518
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:41,803
state-of-the-art mosque.

519
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:43,678
-Mm.
-What?

520
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:46,136
A state-of-the-art what?

521
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:47,845
I know some of you are thinking,

522
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,762
"Okay, this is just
another typical mosque."

523
00:22:50,845 --> 00:22:53,969
This, guys, is going to be

524
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:57,011
the world's largest mosque

525
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:59,303
outside of the Middle East.

526
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:06,303
Just the word alone
scares you.

527
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,428
To me, when I hear the word
"mosque," I think of terrorism.

528
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,928
Is-- Is there a need
for this in Kingman?

529
00:23:11,011 --> 00:23:12,094
Yes, there is.

530
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:13,678
-How? Why?
-How? What?

531
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:18,094
Your town will become a hub
for tourism from--

532
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:20,637
for Muslims around the world.

533
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,678
Can I get a, "Whoop, whoop"?

534
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:23,345
No.

535
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:24,887
We don't want
that shit here.

536
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:27,386
If you bring in Muslims,
we might have a problem.

537
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,011
We probably will
have a problem.

538
00:23:29,094 --> 00:23:30,803
We'll all be moving
out of this state.

539
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:36,553
Okay. Let's...

540
00:23:36,637 --> 00:23:38,053
Before we make up our minds,

541
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:40,345
let's take a closer look...
We've made up our minds.

542
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:42,553
-...at this wonderful mosque.
-We've made up our minds.

543
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:45,845
The Imam Zayed Wahabi Mosque
of Kingman.

544
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,428
Oh, my God.

545
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,428
You guys will have the choice
between two different designs.

546
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:54,345
This is the first design.
This is design one.

547
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:56,303
And this is design two.

548
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:59,219
What the hell
are you asking?

549
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,011
So who here supports design one?

550
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:03,178
Nobody!

551
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:04,969
Okay, so you're all
for design two?

552
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:06,136
-Neither!
-We said no!

553
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:07,428
We don't want
either one!

554
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:09,219
Okay, so let me ask you, sir.

555
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:11,470
You don't like
this construction.

556
00:24:11,553 --> 00:24:13,678
Tell me about your dream mosque.

557
00:24:13,762 --> 00:24:15,637
There is
no dream mosque!

558
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,219
-We don't want a mosque!
-We don't want a mosque!

559
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:18,595
A mosque
is for Muslims.

560
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:21,553
Mosque-- As soon as you said
"mosque," you ruined it.

561
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:23,678
Where is the money
coming from?

562
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,720
It's not going to be
paid for by you.

563
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:28,969
It's primarily going to be paid
for by the Saudi government...

564
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,595
Of course.

565
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,094
...the Clinton Foundation...

566
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:35,094
That's a big fucking mistake
right there.

567
00:24:35,178 --> 00:24:36,470
You should have never
brought that up.

568
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:38,053
She's a piece of work.

569
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:40,053
Around here, that's even
worse than the mosque.

570
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:41,720
Okay, listen.
Can everybody be calm?

571
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:44,053
Can everybody be calm?
This is not a big deal.

572
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:46,303
-This is just a building.
-It's a huge  deal!

573
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,136
-It's a building.
-It's not a building.

574
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,928
It's a fucking
terrorist mosque!

575
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:52,470
What? Okay.
Let me a-address terrorism.

576
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:54,178
Rest assured,
I share your concerns,

577
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,887
and we will do everything we can

578
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:57,511
to protect
these Muslims from it.

579
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,845
The mosque will have
fortified walls,

580
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:01,887
and there will be barricades
to keep the--

581
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,887
Yeah, yeah, to keep the Muslims
safe inside.

582
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:04,928
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

583
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:06,762
Why would we want them
safe inside

584
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:08,595
when we don't even
want them in our town, period?

585
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:10,678
Well, i-it would be to protect
the worshippers

586
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:13,178
from any, uh, violent racists.

587
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,386
It's-- It's not us
that's causing the violence.

588
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,053
It's them.

589
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:18,345
Oh, no, no, no.
Did you--

590
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:20,136
I-- I didn't imply
anybody here is racist.

591
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,219
-Of course not.
-I am.

592
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:23,887
I'm racist
toward Muslims.

593
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:25,928
Let me continue, and then I--

594
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:27,553
That would probably
look good in a fire.

595
00:25:27,637 --> 00:25:29,345
Well, it would be
made out of stone,

596
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:30,678
so it won't be able to burn.

597
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,511
So that's one of
the anti-terrorist measures.

598
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:36,887
I really believe
by the end of this presentation,

599
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,219
you guys are going to be
completely convinced.

600
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:40,803
-You're wrong.
-I doubt it.

601
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:43,094
Let me show you
how your town would change.

602
00:25:43,178 --> 00:25:44,345
-Unh-uh.
-Oh, hell no.

603
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:46,345
You're fucking
kidding me, right?

604
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:47,762
You change the name
on that,

605
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,678
and I guarantee you're gonna
have a fight on your hands.

606
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:51,261
There ain't a goddamn thing
about that we like.

607
00:25:51,345 --> 00:25:53,845
Can we hear from some of
the Muslims in this room?

608
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,803
How do you feel about it, sir?

609
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,219
-Are you a Muslim?
-No.

610
00:25:57,303 --> 00:25:59,011
-There's no Muslims here.
-There is no Muslims here.

611
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:00,845
Oh, there are no Muslims
here at all?

612
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:03,887
This town is lucky
to have black people in it.

613
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:05,928
Yeah, of course you're lucky
to have black people.

614
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,678
They add a lot to the society.

615
00:26:07,762 --> 00:26:09,470
Thank you, sir.

616
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:11,511
Finally,
somebody who appreciates...

617
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:12,637
-No, no, no.
-...multiculturalism.

618
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,762
You're totally missing--
You totally missed--

619
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,219
-Sir, you are completely right.
-No, no.

620
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:17,345
The benefit of having
African-Americans...

621
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:18,845
No.
You're not hearing me out.

622
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:20,345
...means a more diverse...
-You're not hearing him.

623
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:21,595
Thank you, sir.
Don't be ashamed.

624
00:26:21,678 --> 00:26:23,386
He's saying there's
black people in Kingman

625
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,595
that aren't welcome
there either,

626
00:26:24,678 --> 00:26:26,011
but we tolerate them.

627
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:27,553
Okay.

628
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:30,511
One thing I do in Bend, Oregon,
is, sometimes,

629
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:32,678
when there there is
an atmosphere of tension,

630
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:35,845
which there is here, I use music
to alleviate the tension.

631
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:40,553
There is a wonderful song
that I use that relaxes people,

632
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:44,136
and it's from the Xhosa Tribe
in South Africa.

633
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:46,094
It goes like this.

634
00:26:49,595 --> 00:26:51,428
I'm not into that.
I gotta go.

635
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:55,261
There ain't nothing calming
about that at all.

636
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:56,887
I listened
enough to that

637
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:59,720
when I worked at Texaco with--
and I don't...

638
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:01,803
Pardon me, where--
where are you going?

639
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,261
You are triggered,
and you are feeling some anger.

640
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,845
You're pulling
the trigger harder now.

641
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,261
We don't want
to hear that shit.

642
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:12,803
You really think
this is calming us?

643
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:14,845
This will calm
if you close your eyes.

644
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:16,303
It's not calming us!
It's pissing us off!

645
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:19,011
Close your eyes.

646
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:21,386
I understand exactly why
there was told no weapons here.

647
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,928
- Yes!
- Why is that, sir?

648
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:24,428
Because you come down here
and open your mouth

649
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:28,762
and say this kind of shit
in front of us, Arizonites,

650
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:30,470
somebody is
going to get hurt.

651
00:27:30,553 --> 00:27:32,094
Well, I'm going to
write that down.

652
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:13,303
All you damn sand niggers
over in the Middle East,

653
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:16,762
we are tired of you
coming to America,

654
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,303
and we are tired of you
trying to threaten us.

655
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:22,178
We will cut off your dick.

656
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:24,053
You understand?

657
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,969
We will take your dick, and we
will shove it in your mouth,

658
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:29,803
pull it off,
and put it in your mouth.

659
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:31,386
How are you going to rape
children and women

660
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,720
without a dick?

661
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:34,219
I'm Jason Spencer.

662
00:28:34,303 --> 00:28:36,678
I'm an elected official
in the state of Georgia.

663
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:37,969
I'm a State Representative
and member

664
00:28:38,053 --> 00:28:39,303
of the Georgia General Assembly.
