1
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:14,178
Ask not what
your country can do for you.

2
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,845
Ask what you can do
for your country.

3
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:18,470
Mr. Gorbachev,

4
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:20,803
tear down this wall!

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,720
The only thing we have to fear

6
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:25,345
is fear itself!

7
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:28,303
"Uhh, I don't
know what I said. Uhh!"

8
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:52,887
Erev tov.
My name, Captain Erran Morad.

9
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,011
Today, we learn defense
from radical Islam terror.

10
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:57,678
Picture the scene.

11
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:01,928
You are chained to a radiator,
naked with a bag over your head.

12
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:05,345
All of a sudden, terrorists
break in and kidnap you,

13
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:08,261
completely ruining
your birthday party.

14
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:09,470
Yalla.
What we waiting for?

15
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:10,803
Let's go.

16
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,595
My name Erran Morad.

17
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:14,386
I was
in the Mossad for--

18
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,011
I mean, I was not
in the Mossad for 13 years.

19
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,386
I here to teach you Krav Maga.
Who are you?

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,136
My name
is Jason Spencer.

21
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,969
I'm a state representative
in the Georgia General Assembly.

22
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:25,720
That's the House
of Representatives.

23
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:27,178
Jason Spencer, a Republican,

24
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,219
threatened his former
Democratic colleague

25
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:30,887
after she criticized
his support

26
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,178
of Confederate monuments
on Facebook.

27
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,261
Representative Jason Spencer
says his bill

28
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,136
is definitely in response
to mass terrorists.

29
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,053
House Bill 3
would make it illegal

30
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:42,928
for people to conceal
their faces in public.

31
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:44,178
I don't call it
a burka ban.

32
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:46,219
I call it
an anti-masking statute.

33
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:47,386
-Okay.
-Okay, because--

34
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,678
-Politically correct.
-Because in the United--

35
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,470
Well, to win
in the legal system,

36
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:54,553
you cannot-- you cannot
be against the First Amendment.

37
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:56,678
See, this is how
the Muslims in the country

38
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:58,094
are using our First Amendment
against them.

39
00:01:58,178 --> 00:01:59,762
You have to fight
fire with fire.

40
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,595
Yeah, so do you know
how to spot the difference

41
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:06,845
between somebody
who is a terrorist in a burka

42
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,303
and the normal woman
in a burka?

43
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:09,470
I cannot tell.

44
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:11,511
-We have developed a technique.
-Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:13,219
Do you want to know
how to do this?
