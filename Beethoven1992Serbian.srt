00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:46,478
<i>slow down, slow down.</i>
<i>Move it back up.</i>

4
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,714
Here we go.
They're drivin'
me crazy!

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,817
Don't go
too fast.
Come on!
Ow!

6
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,154
<i>Shh. What's the matter?</i>
<i>You threw the</i>
<i>cage on my foot!</i>

7
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,890
I didn't do that.
Yes, you did.

8
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,859
I need puppies.

9
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,097
Okay. All right.
Come on.
Puppies.

10
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,448
Hi, there.
Isn't that the sweetest?

11
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,956
Come here.
Turn around.

12
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,537
He's cool.
Yeah.
He likes us.

13
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,018
Ohh.

14
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,589
<i>What a cute guy.</i>
<i>Isn't he cute?</i>

15
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,212
Hi, puppy.

16
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,849
No, absolutely not.

17
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,900
Well, how big's
he gonna be?

18
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,471
<i>St. Bernards get to be</i>
<i>about 150 pounds.</i>
<i>I got a junkyard.</i>

19
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:29,975
I need a big, mean
junkyard dog.

20
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,478
Let me see him.

21
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,449
Come here,
puppy.

22
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,321
He looks
good and mean.

23
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,391
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>He's pretty sweet.</i>

24
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,227
You can make
any dog mean.

25
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,565
Hey!
Damn little beast!

26
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,634
<i>God!</i>

27
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,039
You got any
pit bulls?

28
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,594
<i>come on.</i>
<i>It's a pushover.</i>

29
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,630
I cased the place.

30
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,599
What about the cops?
Video surveillance?

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,869
You're crazy if you're gonna
just walk up like this.

32
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,472
<i>What about</i>
<i>the alarm?</i>

33
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,754
All you gotta do
is step over.

34
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,228
I got you.
Okay, okay.

35
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,964
There, you see?
In and out, quiet as a mouse.

36
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,667
Get some dogs.

37
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,372
Come on, puppy.
We're just goin' for
a little car ride.

38
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:09,842
Look at the wee, little ones.
Come here, little puppies.

39
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,911
Here we go.
Here we go.

40
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:17,649
Come on, puppy.
Here puppy, nice puppy.

41
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,190
I've stepped in the beam.

42
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:11,370
Here, puppy,
nice puppy.

43
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,319
See, didn't
I tell ya?

44
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,655
Doesn't this beat taki''
strays off the street?

45
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,491
You are a genius!
Get off!

46
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,633
Sorry!
I'm sorry.

47
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:46,105
I'm just a little bit excited.
That's my very first felony.

48
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:50,409
I've committed a lot of
misdemeanors, but I believe
that was my first felony.

49
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,726
<i>why are they barking?</i>

50
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,628
They're dogs.

51
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,232
I know they're dogs!
Go in the back and check.

52
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,971
Okay, doggies, what's
the racket back --

53
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,040
<i>Hey!</i>

54
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,842
Okay, doggies,
back in your house.

55
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,413
<i>Back in your house.</i>
<i>Here doggie, nice doggie.</i>

56
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,085
<i>No, doggie.</i>
<i>Don't jump.</i>

57
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,322
Bad dog!
Good puppy!

58
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,793
<i>Bad puppy, don't jump!</i>
<i>Good puppy, don't jump!</i>

59
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,496
<i>Come back!</i>
<i>Stop the van!</i>

60
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,166
Harv, what is it?
Why did you want me to stop?

61
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,401
Hurry, they're
gettin' away.

62
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,239
<i>Hey, you,</i>
<i>come back here!</i>

63
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,709
Come here!
I'll give you a bone!

64
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,511
<i>Come back here,</i>
<i>you little runt!</i>

65
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,650
Come here, you!
Ahhh!

66
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,598
7:00 a.M.
Up and at 'em!

67
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,679
- ooh!

68
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,348
Oh, ted,
i'm sorry.

69
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:54,153
Mmm. What's wrong?
Did you have another
nightmare?

70
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,989
Yeah.

71
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,360
Mom, it's Saturday
and it's 7:02. Do we
really have to get up?

72
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,729
Yep, you heard
your father.

73
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,698
Oh, gee.

74
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,434
I know,
daddy's rules.

75
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:22,181
<i>that's it! I'm not</i>
<i>gonna take it anymore.</i>

76
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,352
Mom, I have a news flash.
It's Saturday!

77
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,754
<i>- yeah, I know, honey.</i>
<i>- this sucks!</i>

78
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,190
<i>Why do we have to get up</i>
<i>so early on a Saturday?</i>

79
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,559
Ask your father.
Don't say "sucks."

80
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,562
The bathroom's
mine!

81
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,366
<i>Nanny, nanny!</i>
<i>Shut up!</i>
<i>Let me in.</i>

82
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,737
<i>Open up, you</i>
<i>little wimp!</i>
<i>Let me in!</i>

83
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,606
<i>Mom! Let me in!</i>
<i>You have</i>
<i>no bladder control.</i>

84
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:52,211
<i>Wait 'til I get</i>
<i>my hands on you.</i>
<i>Let me in!</i>

85
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,121
A puppy!

86
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:05,224
Hi!

87
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:13,365
<i>guys, do you</i>
<i>have to --</i>

88
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,502
I dreamt I had a puppy
and it came true!

89
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,710
Honey.

90
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:28,380
I take back everything
I said about you being
cold and insensitive.

91
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,382
Wha-- wha--
<i>dad,</i>

92
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,484
I take back anything
I said too.

93
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,354
<i>Dad, I have</i>
<i>everything</i>
<i>I ever wanted.</i>

94
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,289
I owe you
big time.
Why?

95
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,259
Daddy, can we
call him fred?

96
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:48,100
Let me have him.
It's my turn.
No, it's my turn!

97
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:53,172
I saw him first!
I'm gonna have him
for five more minutes.

98
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:57,209
We can't have a dog.
We <i>can't</i> have a dog!

99
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,179
You can't show a child
a puppy then take it
away two minutes later.

100
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,048
I didn't show
a child a puppy.
It's obviously lost.

101
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,819
You occupy the kids.
I'll run it to the pound.
No, no way!

102
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,090
It'll be destroyed.
If we keep it, the house
will be destroyed!

103
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:15,227
Millions of people
have dogs.
Not people like me.

104
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:18,230
Dogs sniff.
They lick, chew.

105
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,599
They drool,
scrat--

106
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,236
Alice, they have
parasites.
Oh, god, yeah.

107
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,906
The kids'll lose interest.
It'll grow to be enormous.

108
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,476
It'll take
over the yard.

109
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,579
When the dog finally
settles down, it'll die.

110
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,850
Everybody will be upset.
We'll have to get another
puppy... Start all over.

111
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,352
<i>Do you understand?</i>
<i>No. Could you be</i>
<i>more specific?</i>

112
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,655
Alice, I need
a little support.
Okay, i'm sorry.

113
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,058
All right.

114
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,161
<i>how shall we</i>
<i>handle this?</i>

115
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,997
Go tell the kids.

116
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:56,502
Come on.
Come over here.

117
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,778
He loves me
the most.

118
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:13,452
Hi, kids.
Hi, dad.

119
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,789
Can he sleep
in my room?
No, in my room.

120
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,859
<i>He's sleeping in my room.</i>
<i>He's not sleeping</i>
<i>in anyone's room.</i>

121
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,495
<i>Listen to me</i>
<i>a minute.</i>

122
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:28,667
We are people people here.
We are goldfish people.

123
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:32,538
We're ant farm people.
We're not dog people.

124
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,407
Dad, why can't you
just give us a chance?

125
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,110
You're always saying
we have to have responsibility.

126
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,313
That's true.

127
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,187
It's my decision.
I mean, i've decided.

128
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,022
I knew it!

129
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,738
Think of something
to name him.

130
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,173
<i>When he destroys my house,</i>
<i>I wanna know what to call him!</i>

131
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,175
Thank you.
This is temporary.

132
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:14,346
This is temporary
until we find the owner.

133
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:20,386
Okay, the dog's name
will be...

134
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,788
What is it?

135
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,858
What's his name gonna be?
You can't change it.
That's the rules.

136
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,993
Okay.
Emily?

137
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,696
<i>Did you do your name</i>
<i>in a crayon?</i>

138
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:34,166
Well, I don't think words
for parts of the body make
good names.

139
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,836
But he's got
one of those.
I looked.

140
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,939
<i>I'm sure he does.</i>
<i>But I don't think daddy...</i>

141
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,276
Wants to stand on the
front porch at night...
Yelling that out.

142
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,279
But that's what
you call uncle richard.

143
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,551
<i>Okay, the dogs</i>
<i>name will be..</i>

144
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,025
You asked
for my input.

145
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,197
What?
Nothing. Let's just
call the dog rover.

146
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,134
Mom, please,
m.C. Hammer.
Ultimate warrior.

147
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,704
M.C. Hammer?
No, no, rover.

148
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,340
He doesn't like
any of those names.

149
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,676
Right, like you can
really read his mind!
Ryce!

150
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,978
<i>Emily, what does the dog</i>
<i>want his name to be?</i>

151
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,483
This is ridiculous!
It's a dog. He doesn't
have preferences!

152
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,754
Call him ding dong head,
he wouldn't know the difference.
Yes, he would!

153
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,757
He'll tell us what
he wants to be called.

00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:12,144

<i>not gonna do me any good.</i>

189
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,179
They said, "no?"
I said, "no."

190
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,584
If this is gonna take off,
I need some capital,
not a band-aid.

191
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,120
"what kind of figures
are we talking about?"

192
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:24,423
<i>I said, "a hundred</i>
<i>and fifty sounds like a</i>
<i>good neighborhood to me."</i>

193
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:28,427
Did you really
say that?
Yeah. This
is a business.

00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:32,398
<i>Advertising, signs;</i>
<i>but i'm optimistic.</i>

195
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,167
- ted, get down here.
<i>- where's my shoes?</i>

196
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:38,337
<i>I don't know, honey,</i>
<i>just backtrack.</i>
<i>Mom, please?</i>

197
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,339
<i>Look behind the</i>

198
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,741
- daddy?
- what?

199
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,943
He wants you to
scratch his head.

200
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,713
Uh, you know--

201
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,916
I don't wanna
scratch his head.
Back off, back off!

202
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,751
But he wants you to.

203
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:56,388
Sometimes we don't get
what we want. That's not
the way the world works.

204
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,323
If I don't get this deal,
i'll kill myself!

205
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,193
Honey, don't talk like that
in front of the kids.

206
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:05,664
If I can just get them to smell
the stuff. Air fresheners
are such a visceral product--

207
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,167
Dad, I got
a great idea.
What?

208
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:10,636
Can I have
karate lessons?

209
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:14,440
I didn't get any bacon.
What do you want
karate lessons for?

210
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:18,177
Brenda's littler than me
and she's got a green belt.

211
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:20,946
Why don't we skip the lessons
and get you the belt?

212
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:30,956
No! Come on!</i>

213
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:35,361
Oh, he slimed me!
He slobbed! Look at this!

214
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,129
<i>don't worry about it.</i>

215
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,131
I've got dog drool
on my pants!

216
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,634
I can't meet with
vanguard capital with
dog drool on my pants!

217
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,005
Just change your pants.
I'm gonna change
my pants.

218
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:49,742
I had a schedule and
now it's gone. I'll
never have that again!

219
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,911
Just change, george.
I'm gonna change
my pants.

220
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,014
If I change my pants,
I gotta change my jacket.

221
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,016
If I change my jacket,
I change my shirt.

222
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:59,118
If I change my shirt,
I change my tie.

223
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,287
<i>I have to change my</i>
<i>belt, shoes, socks.</i>

224
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,491
Just change your pants,
george.

225
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:37,623
I don't need you to
drool all over me,
for god sakes!

226
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:41,193
You're so smart!
What am I telling you about?

227
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:44,596
Listen to me!

228
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,378
Bye, honey.

229
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,314
Sorry.
Good luck.

230
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,817
A little kleenex
or something.

231
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,407
<i>Hi, puppy.</i>

232
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:39,585
<i>Thirsty, huh?</i>

233
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,688
Easy, buddy.
Save some for the fishes.

234
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:53,392
Look at tom.
He's wide open.
Shoot it!

235
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:55,527
<i>Oh!</i>

236
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,396
<i>Put it up.</i>
<i>Put it up!</i>

237
00:24:57,397 --> 00:24:59,598
This guy's
all over me.
Shoot it.

238
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,534
<i>Yeah!</i>

239
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:06,739
<i>all right, that's it.</i>
<i>Hit the showers.</i>

240
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,510
<i>Give me ten.</i>
<i>Let's go, hustle.</i>

241
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,181
Hi, mark.

242
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:22,955
You're sweaty.
You like it?

243
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,862
<i>air fresheners...</i>

244
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:33,766
Are the 12th fastest-growing
area in household hygiene.
Fascinating!

245
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:38,537
All of these use a two-dip
process that guarantees
a longer smell life.

246
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,907
Smell this.
That smell nice?

247
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,546
If we get the right amount
of capital, we can take
this place to the top.

248
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:51,617
I don't mean
just successful,
I mean dominant.

249
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:54,720
Here's a favorite.
Look at this.

250
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,690
- new leather.
- oh, that's cute.

251
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:00,893
- I could use that in my beemer.
- I could use it in my beemer!

252
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,795
A lot of people
could use 'em.

253
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:07,099
I wouldn't want to hang it from
my rearview mirror... Tacky!

254
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,535
No, there's velcro
on the back.

255
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,238
People hide them.
A lot put it under
their dashboard.

256
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,508
Ingenious!
Bravo, newton.
Kudos.

257
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,544
Thank you.

258
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:30,856
Let's get ted.
Hey!

259
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:38,263
Hey, teddy boy.
That's a nice lunch
you got there.

260
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:42,434
A veritable
nutrition lesson.
Oh, yeah.

261
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:47,006
Don't forget to
wash it down with
a big glass of milk.

262
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:50,609
<i>oh, man!</i>

263
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,245
See ya on the bus.

264
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:16,435
Hi! Miss simpkins
made me stay after.

265
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:20,673
Want a twinkie?

266
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:24,209
hold on a minute.

267
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:34,153
Good boy.

268
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:41,927
See over there?

269
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:43,929
That's donna ditsworth.

270
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,933
She's the most popular girl
in the whole school.

271
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:52,304
<i>Her hair is perfect.</i>
<i>Her teeth are perfect.</i>

272
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:55,341
Even mark thinks
she's perfect.

273
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,749
Beethoven!

274
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,695
Hey, check out fido.

275
00:28:18,231 --> 00:28:23,869
<i>- what a cool lookin' dog.</i>
<i>- I bet you wanna play fetch.</i>

276
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,339
You gotta give me
the stick if you
want me to throw it.

277
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,009
Hey,
where we going?

278
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,852
Cool dog.
Cool dog.

279
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:42,154
Is he yours?

280
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:45,557
- what's his name?
- beethoven.

281
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,193
Wow.
Hi, beethoven.
Hey, beethoven.

282
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,596
<i>cool dog.</i>
<i>Good boy.</i>

283
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:55,200
Well,
see you later, ryce.

284
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:01,907
Yes!
He knows my name!

285
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:06,345
he knows my name.

286
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:09,915
No question about it.
You've built yourself
something impressive.

287
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,985
Thank you
very much.

288
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:15,020
That mean
you're interested?
Absolutely.

289
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:17,589
We've smelled
a lot of stuff.

290
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:21,026
I speak for myself as
well as the "brie meister"
when I say...

291
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:23,262
Yours smells the best.

292
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:25,998
That's great.
Thanks a lot.

293
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:28,200
We're gonna crunch
some numbers and...

294
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,836
Maybe we can get
together later.
<i>That would be great.</i>

295
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:33,472
We're looking forward
to it.
I'll get it.

296
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:35,541
Thank you.
Ciao.

297
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:38,977
Ciao, george.
Ciao bello.

298
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,814
- ciao bello.
- ciao!

299
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:44,350
Ciao.

300
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,252
Ciao.

301
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:27,426
How ya doin',
theodore?

302
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:30,529
- nice backpack, teddy!
- can I see it?

303
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:34,533
Oh... Whoops!
Sorry!

304
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:37,302
Why do you guys
always pick on me?

305
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,805
'cause you're a
little four-eyed dork.

306
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:41,840
<i>Give them back!</i>

307
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:44,610
<i>They're mine.</i>
<i>Give them back!</i>

308
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:47,780
Ahhh.
Where you going,
teddy?

309
00:30:57,557 --> 00:31:00,359
<i>Wait up, theodore.</i>
<i>We wanna walk you home.</i>

310
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:18,610
<i>What are you?</i>
<i>A chicken?</i>

311
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,279
Ah, come on.
Scaredy-cat!

312
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,388
Scared?
Come on, fight me.

313
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,057
Now he
can't even see.
<i>Blind as a bat!</i>

314
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:35,327
What's going
on here?

315
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:37,629
<i>He looks mean!</i>

316
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,498
<i>Y-yeah.</i>

317
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:43,402
Give him
the glasses.
Sorry.

318
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:55,914
And don't come back!

319
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:17,436
I know it doesn't mean
that he likes me.

320
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:23,142
But he's gotta like me
better than before
he said my name.

321
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,744
You think he could
like me, beethoven?

322
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:32,718
I know you like me.</i>

323
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:35,821
Good night,
sweetheart.

324
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,790
You... Out!

325
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,992
Good night,
beethoven.

326
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:44,930
Good night, honey.
Good night, dad.

327
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:54,073
Mark.

328
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:58,344
All right!
You, in here!

329
00:32:58,345 --> 00:33:01,847
You sleep in here.
I sleep there. You--

330
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:03,816
Oh.

331
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:06,719
<i>See, that's</i>
<i>very nice.</i>

332
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,290
That's progress.
I appreciate that.
Good night.

333
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,628
Good night.

334
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:25,971
Ever since you started
looking for investors
you seem--

335
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:30,042
You wanted us to expand.
I want you
to be happy.

336
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:33,445
You even said you'd
come back to work.

337
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:36,515
I said d'd give you
one wish for your birthday.

338
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:40,352
Well, I wish you'd
come back to work.

339
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:42,988
There's other things
that are important.

340
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:45,290
I like being home
when the kids get home.

341
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,426
I don't want them to
come home to some stranger.

342
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:52,031
We'll get a great sitter,
somebody reliable that
the kids'll just love.

343
00:34:23,997 --> 00:34:27,599
...In the 3rd
occurrence this month.

344
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,104
We've seen a 500% increase
in the reported incidence
of stolen pets.

345
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:35,107
<i>Police believe an animal</i>
<i>kidnapping ring is at work.</i>

346
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:37,309
<i>That's "news break."</i>
<i>now back to "the wolfman."</i>

347
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,112
Did you
hear something?
No.

348
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:42,247
I heard something
downstairs.

349
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:46,418

350
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,554

351
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:01,400
¶

352
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:53,952
You were right.
The tv was on.

353
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:58,023
I don't know.
I hope i'm doing
the right thing.

354
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:01,160
It feels like a good idea
to expand...

355
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:04,263
But I don't want to do it
at everybody's expense.

356
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:07,666
We have to get somebody
wonderful to take care
of the kids.

357
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,102
There's no question
about that.

358
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:12,838
It's hard to know
what the right thing is.

359
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:18,310
No matter how many
showers I take,

360
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:22,848
I still smell beethoven
all over me.

361
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:26,518
Are you okay?
You're so quiet.

362
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,254
You're not mad at me,
are you?

363
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,361
Ohhh.
Oh, baby!

364
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:40,099
Oh, baby, it's not even
Saturday night.

365
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,568
Oh, alice, you
drive me crazy.

366
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:46,739
Oh, has daddy's little girl
been naughty tonight?

367
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,274
<i>george?</i>

368
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,443
Who you talking to?

369
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:05,591
Aaaah!

370
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:08,660
How dare you!
Are you crazy?

371
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:11,697
Did you think you were
gonna get away with it?

372
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:16,435
Ohh... That's
how you do it!

373
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:19,338
I'll put a
stop to that.

374
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:22,941
<i>You've ruined my life,</i>
<i>my furniture, my clothes!</i>

375
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:26,679
My family likes you
more than they like me.

376
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,515
Why? All you do
is drool and shed.

377
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:33,819
<i>You're never getting out</i>
<i>of there again... Never!</i>

378
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,555
Do we understand
each other?

379
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:39,358
Do we--

380
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:45,698
Ahhh.

381
00:38:02,015 --> 00:38:04,783
Hey, little buddy.
How ya doin'?

382
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,852
Thank you.
Good work.

383
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:18,630
Ssss.

384
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:22,334
Vernon!
Come on,
harvey.

385
00:38:22,335 --> 00:38:24,803
Can I tell you
something?
What?

386
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:27,006
I don't like it
when you tease the dogs.

387
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:30,442
Are you some kind
of animal lover?

388
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:51,063
<i>we've developed a new</i>
<i>type of ammunition.</i>

389
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:53,565
<i>It explodes on contact.</i>

390
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:57,369
We'd like you to use this
revolver for the tests.

391
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:01,507
We want to know the
extent of the damage
at close range.

392
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:10,249
You wanna know
how messy it is.

393
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,388
I presume you can get
dogs with big skulls
for the tests.

394
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:19,591
<i>Newfoundlands,</i>
<i>great danes,</i>
<i>st. Bernards.</i>

395
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:21,760
Large dogs are
difficult to come by,

396
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:25,364
<i>Harder to manage.</i>

397
00:39:38,812 --> 00:39:41,980
I'm sure we'll
be able to handle it.

398
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:13,112
Mr. Newton?
<i>Yes.</i>

399
00:40:13,113 --> 00:40:16,982
I'm dr. Varnick.
This must be beethoven.

400
00:40:16,983 --> 00:40:18,751
Uh-hmm.

401
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:23,088
Ah, he's a magnificent
animal. Magnificent!

402
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:27,026
Magnificent, ahh!

403
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:29,628
In for his shots?
<i>that's right.</i>

404
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:32,464
He'll be a little groggy
this evening.

405
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:34,633
That'll be nice.

406
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:37,870
You should leave him
over night for observation.

407
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:40,773
I'd be happy to.
Dad!

408
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:42,941
It's just a shot.
He'll be okay.

409
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:46,712
Let's take him home.
He's scared and wants
to go home.

410
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:51,650
Mr. Newton, I wonder if I
might have a word with you
privately.

411
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:52,818
Sure.

412
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:56,622
Good dog.

413
00:40:57,691 --> 00:41:00,926
Take good care of
these nice people.

414
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:03,962
They aren't gonna
hurt beethoven, are they?

415
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:06,699
<i>nothing could</i>
<i>hurt beethoven.</i>

416
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:14,940
Ohh.

417
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:20,979
Please,
sit down.

418
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:28,387
Mr. Newton,
have you, ah--

419
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:32,157
Have you noticed anything
strange about your dog lately?

420
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:40,532
You know, I mean he's--
he's destroyed my life.

421
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:43,702
- I wish I was kidding.

422
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:48,440
That's very funny.
St. Bernards have
been heavily over-bred.

423
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:53,912
There's been quite
a bit written about
behavioral problems.

424
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:57,082
What kind
of problems?
Well...

425
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:01,854
I don't know how to tell you
this, but i've had to put down
several over the past months.

426
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,691
<i>They have a tendency</i>
<i>to turn on people,</i>

427
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,093
<i>Attack without</i>
<i>provocation.</i>

428
00:42:08,094 --> 00:42:12,598
I only mention this
because you have children.

429
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:21,740
Good boy!

430
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:24,910
<i>george, come on.</i>

431
00:42:24,911 --> 00:42:28,614
Beethoven isn't even
remotely dangerous.
He'd never hurt the kids.

432
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:30,949
He might take a bite
out of you, though.

433
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:35,621
First snarl, first any kind
of weirdness, and he's gone.

434
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:40,359
Weirdness?
What should I watch for,
his wearing my clothes?

435
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:48,300
good boy!

436
00:42:48,301 --> 00:42:51,337
You guys are
gonna love devonia.

437
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:53,672
I don't need
a baby-sitter.

438
00:42:53,673 --> 00:42:57,042
how come you gotta
go back to work?

439
00:42:57,043 --> 00:43:00,612
There's no point of
us going into this
with a bad attitude.

440
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:03,649
Hi there,
you little cutie!

441
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,618
Don't you worry
about a thing.

442
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:09,822
We're gonna
get along great.
Right, kids?

443
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:13,125
I'll be back
before dinner so
it's not that long.

444
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:15,094
We're gonna do
neat stuff.

445
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:18,831
I was hopin' we could
sing a tune together.
You like music?

446
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:20,766
<i>what kind</i>
<i>of music?</i>

447
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:25,404
How about herb alpert
and the tijuana brass?
Oh, sorry.

448
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:28,340
<i>I am a nut for</i>
<i>the disco beat!</i>

449
00:43:28,341 --> 00:43:31,910
Okay, kids,
be good.

450
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:53,465
You've had some time
to think and--
and made our decision.

451
00:43:57,203 --> 00:44:00,572
We wanna get in bed with
newton auto air fresheners.

452
00:44:00,573 --> 00:44:02,941
Excellent!
That's just great!

453
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:05,811
Thank you
very much.
As quickly
as possible.

454
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:08,313
<i>We meet our lawyers</i>
<i>today and have</i>
<i>the papers drawn up.</i>

456
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,384
Let us take you
out to dinner.

457
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:14,653
Are there any good
restaurants in this burgh?

458
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:18,757
Ah... Restaurants.
Uh, what?

459
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:22,695
Why don't you
come to our house?
We'll barbecue.

460
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:27,566
Barbecue!
Let's live dangerously!

461
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:31,704
Well, our food may not be great,
but it's not dangerous.

462
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:35,107

than this espresso.

481
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:14,133
The pool?

482
00:47:15,568 --> 00:47:19,605
Emily!
<i>What are you doing</i>

483

Get out this instant.
You want to get me
into trouble?

484
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:25,144
Emily, are
you all right?
I fell in.

485
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:27,780
Oh, emily,
you must've been so scared!

486
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:30,416
I thought
I was gonna die.

00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,618
Oh, you poor
little thing.

488
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:36,855
Now, you were never
in any real danger, were you?

489
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:42,061
We don't want you to get
into trouble so we'll let
this be our little secret.

490
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:45,264
I'd like to call
my mother, please.

491
00:47:45,265 --> 00:47:48,300
Your mother?
Immediately.

492
00:47:51,171 --> 00:47:54,540
She must've snuck out while
I was watching ted and ryce.

493
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:58,210
It was hot out
so I guess she wanted
to take a little swim.

494
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:01,447
And where were you while
all this was happening?

495
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:05,284
Where I was supposed to be,
inside watching the other two.

496
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:08,954
If emily had stayed
where I put her, none
of this would've happened.

497
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:13,459
<i>If you ask me, what</i>
<i>these children need</i>
<i>is a little discipline.</i>

498
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,862
What these children need
is their mother.

499
00:48:16,863 --> 00:48:19,565
You're fired.

500
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:22,134
<i>honey, it was an accident.</i>
<i>So what?</i>

501
00:48:22,135 --> 00:48:25,604
We can't throw out
having a baby-sitter
because we had a bad one.

502
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:30,075
We'll find somebody
responsible to look
after the kids.

503
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:33,045
Over my dead body.
Oh, come on.

504
00:48:36,483 --> 00:48:40,519
We're fine on our own.
You don't have to entertain us.

505
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:50,596
Do you have any kids?

506
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:55,968
We have a career.

507
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:58,170
Big one.

508
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:00,572
Excuse us.

509
00:49:06,346 --> 00:49:08,514
Brats.
Monsters.

510
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:10,683
If we pull this off,

511
00:49:10,684 --> 00:49:15,054
In six months we will own
newton auto air fresheners.

512
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:17,156
Touch it.

513
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:22,161
<i>sorry for the delay.</i>

514
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:24,697
We, we, we --
<i>no problem.</i>

515
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:26,965
Vegetables.
Here you go.
Look at that.

516
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:31,770
Here's the paperwork,
giorgio.
I've got my own chair, honey.

517
00:49:38,878 --> 00:49:40,579
At that.
Vegetables.
Here you go.
You gonna do that now,
honey?          Look at that.

518
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,081
Alicia.

519
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:44,049
Alice.
Alice.

520
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:47,186
i'm sorry. Alice.
Could I have a refill, please?

521
00:49:48,788 --> 00:49:50,422
<i>Sure.</i>

522
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:52,458
Thank you.

523
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:57,863
Just right down
at the bottom, george.

524
00:49:57,864 --> 00:50:01,967
<i>this is everything</i>
<i>we've discussed?</i>

525
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:03,969
<i>oh, yes, exactly.</i>

526
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,305
<i>right at the bottom</i>
<i>you can sign.</i>

527
00:50:08,074 --> 00:50:11,110
Hon, don't sign that now.
Why don't we have a little
something to eat?

528
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:14,279
<i>You can read</i>
<i>it over --</i>
<i>alice, tell me</i>
<i>about your dog.</i>

529
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,783
Ah, gee.
Well, he's a dog.

530
00:50:17,784 --> 00:50:21,720
He sure is!
Hello, cutesy-ootsy.

531
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:25,758
He's a st. Bernard.
He's a purebred st. Bernard,
isn't he?

532
00:50:25,759 --> 00:50:30,829
hello. Oh, look at
that big old tongue!

533
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:34,266
Look at that.
Come here. Oh, yeah.

534
00:50:34,267 --> 00:50:37,836
You wanna come with mommy
and daddy? Yes, you do.

535
00:50:37,837 --> 00:50:40,039
Oh, come on. We'll come
to mommy and daddy.

536
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,074
Come on, come on!

537
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:44,410
I just love these
big, dumb animals.

538
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:46,745
I bet you do.

539
00:50:46,746 --> 00:50:49,648
Dogs obey so much better
than children, don't they?

540
00:50:49,649 --> 00:50:53,986
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Oh, look, cutesy-ootsy-oogy.</i>

541
00:50:53,987 --> 00:50:59,391
<i>Oh, mama just loves</i>
<i>this great big doggie-woggie.</i>

542
00:51:00,694 --> 00:51:03,729
<i>the places</i>
<i>for you to sign...</i>

543
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,331
Are marked by that
blue clip right there.

544
00:51:06,332 --> 00:51:08,400
<i>This is all</i>
<i>standard stuff?</i>

545
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:11,437
You sure you wanna
"signee-wignee" right now?

546
00:51:11,438 --> 00:51:15,174
Oh!
Alice, i'm sorry.

547
00:51:15,175 --> 00:51:18,210
I've got that. I don't
want you to break a nail.

548
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:22,247
Right down there where
the blue arrow is.

549
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:26,585
Honey, you sit.
I've got this.

550
00:51:29,556 --> 00:51:32,658
You guys don't seem
to have made a good impression.
I'm crushed.

551
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:35,094
Me too.
I'll cry all night.

552
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:39,031
I don't like 'em either.
But these people are important
to dad's business.

553
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:42,568
I hope beethoven slimes
that lady's dress.

554
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:44,970
if you don't
want our capital,

555
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:47,306
We could find another
investment somewhere else.

556
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:50,376
- sure!
- no, no, no, no.

557
00:51:51,544 --> 00:51:56,148
- beethoven, down, down.
- is there some problem?

558
00:51:56,149 --> 00:51:58,083
No, no.
Did I miss anything?

559
00:51:58,084 --> 00:52:00,919
No. Giorgio has gone over
all the papers...

560
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,288
And he's about
to sign.

561
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:05,724
Just standard stuff,
really.

562
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,661
Will you get outta here,
you... Mutt!

563
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,167
I pitched in college.

564
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:35,587
<i>beethoven, stop!</i>

565
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:37,623
Ah, bad dog!

566
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:40,926
Sit! Stop! Stay!

567
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:43,295
Ohhh... No!

568
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:55,274
Beethoven!

569
00:53:23,703 --> 00:53:26,205
I really don't like
our dog.

570
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:30,809
<i>I really don't like</i>
<i>those people.</i>

571
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,945
<i>I don't trust them.</i>

572
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:37,016
I don't want
their money.

573
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:41,220
I know my opinion
doesn't matter, but...

574
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,789
I'm not interested
in expanding.

575
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,425
If I had been home
instead of helping you
impress those morons,

576
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:48,494
Emily wouldn't have
fallen in the pool.

577
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:51,697
<i>And i'm not reentering</i>
<i>the work force, george.</i>

578
00:53:51,698 --> 00:53:54,566
You're gonna have
to do this on your own.

579
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,237
<i>And you will.</i>

580
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:01,140
Somehow you'll make
your fortune.

581
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:04,943
And tucked away behind you
deep in the shadows
will be me and the kids.

582
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:12,418
That's how
you see me.

583
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:15,721
Suddenly i'm a lousy
husband and father.

584
00:54:15,722 --> 00:54:21,226
Everything was fine
until beethoven
came into our lives.

585
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:26,131
I've tried
to be patient,
but i've had it.

586
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:28,334
The dog has to go.

587
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:30,235
<i>i'm proud of beethoven.</i>

588
00:54:30,236 --> 00:54:33,339
Those two idiots
insulted your kids,
treated me like dirt...

589
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:37,710
And he was the only one of us
who had the nerve to give them
the ride they deserved.

590
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:41,080
I'm going to bed.

591
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:46,752
My dream's going down
the drain and you're
worried about a dog.

592
00:54:49,556 --> 00:54:52,624
Your family's going
down the drain and
you're worried about a dream.

593
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:17,116
Oh, hush.

594
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:20,753
Why do we gotta be
so quiet?
Shh!

595
00:55:47,147 --> 00:55:49,848
You're a big boy!

596
00:56:27,087 --> 00:56:29,788
Sit down.
We made you breakfast,
dad.

597
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:33,092
Scrambled eggs
just the way you like them.
I fed beethoven.

598
00:56:33,093 --> 00:56:34,893
<i>We washed him too.</i>

599
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,264
You should smell him.

600
00:56:39,265 --> 00:56:41,233
I'm gonna walk beethoven
every day.

601
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:44,970
We've divided up the dog chores
so that you won't have to do
anything for beethoven...

602
00:56:44,971 --> 00:56:48,273
<i>From now on.</i>
<i>I see.</i>

603
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:52,778
Is there anything
else you need?
Anything else at all?

604
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:55,347
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

605
00:56:58,651 --> 00:57:03,255
I dropped part of
an egg shell in there.

606
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:05,758
Chew carefully, dad.

607
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:14,199
<i>okay, fine. Great, ryce.</i>
<i>I'm gonna get that thing.</i>

608
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,035
That leaf's mine.
I get the next one!

609
00:57:16,036 --> 00:57:18,404
Okay, fine.
Get that question box.

610
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:20,673
Give me five.

611
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:22,808
Shake.

612
00:57:27,747 --> 00:57:29,682
Ah!
Ah, mrs. Newton.

613
00:57:29,683 --> 00:57:32,584
Yes.
I'm dr. Varnick,
the veterinarian.

614
00:57:32,585 --> 00:57:35,854
I'm sorry
to trouble you,

615
00:57:35,855 --> 00:57:38,657
But I wonder
if I might come in?

616
00:57:41,027 --> 00:57:42,628
Well, sure.
Come on in.

617
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:44,697
With animals
as large as yours,

618
00:57:44,698 --> 00:57:48,801
I like to do a follow-up
on rabies shots just
to see how he's doing.

619
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:52,171
It's really nice of you
to come down here.
No trouble at all.

620
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:55,741
Here you go.
Thank you.
I'll only be a moment.

621
00:57:55,742 --> 00:57:57,910
<i>would you like</i>
<i>a lemonade?</i>

622
00:57:57,911 --> 00:58:00,112
Oh, no, i'll be fine.
Thank you.
All right.

623
00:58:00,113 --> 00:58:03,015
Well, beethoven,
how are you doing?

624
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,987
<i>Lookin' good.</i>
<i>Lookin' good.</i>

625
00:58:16,896 --> 00:58:19,565
<i>Beethoven, this</i>
<i>is gonna hurt you...</i>

626
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:22,768
A lot more than
it hurts me.

627
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:26,238
But it's a great
benefit to mankind.

628
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:28,640
Put some of this here.

629
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:31,076
- i'm gonna get those bones.
- no, I get some!

630
00:58:31,077 --> 00:58:33,112
<i>You get the next one.</i>

631
00:58:37,384 --> 00:58:41,153
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>that'll do ya.</i>

632
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,692
<i>All right now.</i>

633
00:58:52,132 --> 00:58:55,634
- no!
- emily, what's the matter?

634
00:58:55,635 --> 00:58:58,037
Come on,
you big stupid mutt!

635
00:59:00,173 --> 00:59:02,675
Help! Help!

636
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:09,615
George!
Oh, my god!

637
00:59:09,616 --> 00:59:12,718
Help, somebody!
Help!

638
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:14,787
Good boy. Good boy!

639
00:59:14,788 --> 00:59:17,923
Beethoven! Beethoven!

640
00:59:17,924 --> 00:59:20,192
No!
<i>Get off him.</i>

641
00:59:20,193 --> 00:59:22,561
Beethoven!

642
00:59:22,562 --> 00:59:25,664
Beethoven.
Oh my gosh, beethoven!

643
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:30,202
<i>- why'd he do that?</i>
<i>- my gosh, look what he did!</i>

644
00:59:30,203 --> 00:59:33,238
Are you all right?
Well, I --
I don't know.

645
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:36,175
What happened?
He just lunged at me!

646
00:59:36,176 --> 00:59:39,411
That's not true.
I saw you hit beethoven.

647
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:44,650
Emily, please.
Why would I hit beethoven?
I patted him on the head.

648
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:46,552
It's possible that
from a distance the child--

649
00:59:46,553 --> 00:59:48,387
Liar!

650
00:59:48,388 --> 00:59:51,890
Emily!
Oh, i'm sorry.
Everything's all right.

651
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:55,627
It's very natural the child
would want to defend her dog.

652
00:59:55,628 --> 00:59:58,330
Let's call
an ambulance.
No, no.
I'll take care of it.

653
00:59:58,331 --> 01:00:01,200
<i>I'll take care</i>
<i>of this myself.</i>

654
01:00:03,303 --> 01:00:05,571
I'm terribly sorry.

655
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:08,307
He's never done anything
like this before.

656
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:12,778
Once an animal crosses the line
and attacks a human being,

657
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:16,081
You can rest assured
he'll do it again.

658
01:00:16,082 --> 01:00:18,617
Of course, next time it
could be one of your children.

659
01:00:18,618 --> 01:00:22,688
I'm very, very sorry.
Let me help.

660
01:00:22,689 --> 01:00:25,924
Mr. Newton, we have
a real problem here.

661
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:29,728
The law is very clear when
it comes to dealing with this.

662
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:31,897
Unless you bring the animal
to my office immediately,

663
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:35,434
I'm afraid i'll be forced
to press charges.

664
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:44,209
I'm, i'm so sorry.

665
01:00:56,222 --> 01:01:00,125
<i>I don't want anything</i>
<i>to happen to beethoven.</i>

666
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:05,531
Dad won't believe us
'cause he hates beethoven.

667
01:01:05,532 --> 01:01:09,068
He's always
hated beethoven.

668
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:04,556
Dad has beethoven!

669
01:02:04,557 --> 01:02:07,092
Wait, wait!
Stop!

670
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:16,535
Stop!
Daddy!

671
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:21,407
Wait!

672
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:23,242
Wait!

673
01:02:46,966 --> 01:02:51,904
My dad had to take our dog
to the vet to be put down.

674
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:54,073
I hated him for it.

675
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:58,610
Now i'm doing it myself.

676
01:03:01,548 --> 01:03:05,584
I know you won't believe me,
but I don't wanna do this.

677
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,925
You understand.

678
01:03:12,926 --> 01:03:15,627
It's not your fault.

679
01:03:41,154 --> 01:03:43,689
Mr. Newton.
Dr. Varnick.

680
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,893
I know that you're doing
the right thing.

681
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:50,696
I hope so.

682
01:03:50,697 --> 01:03:52,297
Follow me.

683
01:03:56,903 --> 01:03:58,771
Come on, come on.

684
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:01,006
How is your arm?

685
01:04:01,007 --> 01:04:03,442
Oh, it's fine, fine.

686
01:04:03,443 --> 01:04:07,479
37 stitches.
I'm so sorry.

687
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,915
Do you want the collar
and tags?

688
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:14,853
Some people like
to keep them.
Yeah.

689
01:04:14,854 --> 01:04:18,624
Do you mind?
I have the bad wing.

690
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:22,194
Come here.
Come here.

691
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,448
I'm sorry.

692
01:04:43,483 --> 01:04:46,251
You were my dog too.

693
01:04:58,531 --> 01:05:00,532
Sad state of affairs.

694
01:05:00,533 --> 01:05:04,336
Sad state of affairs.
Come on, boy. Come on.

695
01:05:04,337 --> 01:05:06,572
<i>Come on, boy.</i>

696
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:10,943
In you go.
There you go.

697
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:15,314
All right.
Magnificent.

698
01:05:30,663 --> 01:05:32,898
George newton.

699
01:05:32,899 --> 01:05:35,601
We're gonna have to charge
you for a day's boarding...

700
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:39,238
Because jimmy, who handles the
lethal injections and disposals,

701
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:42,241
He doesn't work today
so we're gonna have to
hold the dog overnight.

702
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:45,144
<i>Should we bill you?</i>

703
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:38,764
Dog killer!

704
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:44,503
Nice dog, huh, doc?
<i>He's perfect for</i>
<i>the ammo experiment.</i>

705
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:47,473
Get everything ready.
I'll be by in the morning.

706
01:06:47,474 --> 01:06:49,575
We'll do the test
on him first thing.

707
01:06:49,576 --> 01:06:52,044
All right.

708
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:01,220
<i>Nice doggie,</i>
<i>good doggie.</i>

709
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:03,288
<i>Okay, close the door.</i></i>

710
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:06,525
I've got him.
Come on!

711
01:07:06,526 --> 01:07:09,762
Good doggie.
Come here, doggie.

712
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:11,797
Okay, I got him.
Good, good.

713
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:15,901
I got him.
Come on, doggie.
Not you! The dog!

714
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:19,405
Put him in.
Okay, you got him?

715
01:07:19,406 --> 01:07:22,174
In the cage.
Get in.

716
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:34,920
<i>shut up!</i>

717
01:07:34,921 --> 01:07:36,955
There.

718
01:07:36,956 --> 01:07:39,491
Doc will work on him
first thing in the morning...

719
01:07:39,492 --> 01:07:41,727
And then he's
one dead puppy.

720
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:43,896
Can we eat?

721
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:45,998
Yeah.
You hungry?
Yeah.
I'm hungry.

722
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:49,535
<i>What do you feel like?</i>
<i>A chef's salad.</i>

723
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:04,149
Did I do
the wrong thing?

724
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:08,053
I don't know,
honey.

725
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:14,660
Beethoven made
this house real.

726
01:08:17,497 --> 01:08:20,299
He put the
dents in it.

727
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:27,206
I know he slobbered
and he smelled bad,
but he loved us.

728
01:08:29,442 --> 01:08:31,910
Even you.

729
01:08:35,882 --> 01:08:38,283
I just hope your motives
were pure...

730
01:08:38,284 --> 01:08:40,986
And you did this for
the safety of the kids.

731
01:08:40,987 --> 01:08:43,856
Because I really hate
to think we sold beethoven
down the river...

732
01:08:43,857 --> 01:08:47,359
For a piece of carpet
or a chance to sell
more air freshener.

733
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,629
It had nothing to do with
carpet or air freshener.
You saw what he did.

734
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:54,566
I know. But we don't
know why he did it.

735
01:08:54,567 --> 01:08:58,170
Maybe the vet didn't hit him,
but maybe he handled him
too rough or something.

736
01:08:58,171 --> 01:09:00,506
Emily's really
sticking to this.

737
01:09:00,507 --> 01:09:03,942
Have we ever known her
to attack an adult and
accuse them of lying?

738
01:09:03,943 --> 01:09:06,912
No, but why would
a vet say that?

739
01:09:06,913 --> 01:09:09,982
Instead of listening to some
guy we've met only twice,

740
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:13,819
Maybe we should try
listening to our own child.

741
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:19,158
Honey, something
doesn't make sense.
Can't we talk to him?

742
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:21,393
Oh, what do you
want me to do?

743
01:09:21,394 --> 01:09:25,097
Dr. Varnick, are you sure
you didn't hit our dog?

744
01:09:25,098 --> 01:09:27,866
Yes, mr. Newton,
I just remembered
I did hit your dog.

745
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:31,670
Come on!
George, it would make me
feel better. Let's just go.

746
01:09:32,772 --> 01:09:35,874
I'm coming with you.
So am I.

747
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:38,077
We're all going
with you.

748
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:55,127
<i>I'm terribly sorry.</i>

749
01:09:55,128 --> 01:09:57,429
We want
our dog back!
Where's beethoven?

750
01:09:57,430 --> 01:10:00,132
Kids, let daddy
handle this.
What can I do for you?

751
01:10:00,133 --> 01:10:03,335
We want our dog back!
I'm terribly sorry.

752
01:10:03,336 --> 01:10:07,039
It's too late.
The dog's been destroyed.

753
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,042
Dad?
Now wait a minute.

754
01:10:10,043 --> 01:10:13,178
I was told this wouldn't
happen until tomorrow.
I don't believe you.

755
01:10:13,179 --> 01:10:16,749
Hey, hey, hey.
Take your hands off her!

756
01:10:22,856 --> 01:10:26,125
I told you
he was lying.

757
01:10:26,126 --> 01:10:29,795
What the hell
are you trying to pull?

758
01:10:29,796 --> 01:10:32,097
You can't come in here.
This is private property.

759
01:10:32,098 --> 01:10:34,400
Beethoven?

760
01:10:37,504 --> 01:10:40,172
he's not here.
Hold it right there.

761
01:10:40,173 --> 01:10:42,474
You have no right
to be in here.
Out, all of you.

762
01:10:42,475 --> 01:10:44,276
Where's my dog?

763
01:10:44,277 --> 01:10:47,212
I don't have to answer
your questions.

764
01:10:47,213 --> 01:10:50,416
You ordered that dog destroyed
and it was done. Now get out.

765
01:10:51,918 --> 01:10:55,988
You hit me, i'll have you put
in jail for assault and battery.

766
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:08,567
Whoa!
Dad!

767
01:11:08,568 --> 01:11:10,669
Honey!
That was amazing.

768
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,038
<i>dad, you were awesome.</i>

769
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:17,142
You were really cool.
Really, I never found you
more attractive.

770
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:20,946
I may need
an x-ray.

771
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:24,783
He said our dog bit him.
But he didn't really.
Tell him.

772
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:27,786
There were no bite marks
on his arm!

773
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:32,057
"so what?"
what do you mean?

774
01:11:32,058 --> 01:11:34,793
I'd like to file
a report on you!

775
01:11:34,794 --> 01:11:37,396
What? They're not
going to help us?

776
01:11:37,397 --> 01:11:39,365
Not this year.
<i>Shh. Dad?</i>

777
01:11:39,366 --> 01:11:41,133
Look.
Dr. Varnick.

778
01:11:51,745 --> 01:11:53,846
Let's follow him.

779
01:11:53,847 --> 01:11:56,949
Maybe he'll lead us
to beethoven.

780
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:04,390
Hold your door.
Hold your door.

781
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:08,427
Shut it.

782
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:16,502
dad, haven't you ever
followed anyone?

783
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:19,905
Turn off your lights.

784
01:12:39,292 --> 01:12:42,261
I think that's
the last of it.
Start getting the dogs.

785
01:12:42,262 --> 01:12:44,029
The dogs?

786
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:47,866
Yeah! He said we gotta
destroy all the evidence.

787
01:13:31,544 --> 01:13:34,113
I'm gonna check this out.

788
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:44,089
It's 9:30.

789
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:46,425
<i>If i'm not back</i>
<i>in 15 minutes,</i>

790
01:13:46,426 --> 01:13:48,994
Call the police.

791
01:13:48,995 --> 01:13:51,864
Don't come in
after me.

792
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:59,905
Before you
destroy the dogs,

793
01:13:59,906 --> 01:14:02,908
Bring me the st. Bernard
for the ammo test.

794
01:14:02,909 --> 01:14:05,511
Okay.

795
01:14:05,512 --> 01:14:08,781
And bring me a little one
for this chemical test.

796
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:11,784
Sure.
I know just the one.

797
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:14,486
Hurry up.

798
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:31,303
<i>Latch.</i>

799
01:14:38,211 --> 01:14:41,714
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>You're gonna be a pioneer.</i>

800
01:14:41,715 --> 01:14:44,783
Like davy crockett,
right?
Right.

801
01:15:01,868 --> 01:15:04,169
Good doggie!

802
01:15:13,713 --> 01:15:16,181
Oh no! No, no!

803
01:15:35,468 --> 01:15:38,070
I'm saving you.
I'm saving you!

804
01:15:51,117 --> 01:15:54,887
<i>He pushed me on the ground</i>
<i>and I couldn't get up.</i>

805
01:15:59,526 --> 01:16:02,394
Emily, come on.
Here, ryce, take her.

806
01:16:02,395 --> 01:16:06,231
Lock the doors.
If i'm not back in 15--

807
01:16:06,232 --> 01:16:10,102
I'll be back.
Lock the doors.
Lock that one.

808
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:20,179
Nice doggie.

809
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:23,415
We're gonna have a field test
with this new ammo.

810
01:16:26,052 --> 01:16:28,087
So long.

811
01:16:39,032 --> 01:16:42,868
You're a very foolish man,
mr. Newton.

812
01:16:42,869 --> 01:16:44,636
<i>You should've left</i>
<i>well enough alone.</i>

813
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:53,879
That was a gun!
Daddy!

814
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,082
<i>- mom, get over here!</i>
<i>- there's no time!</i>

815
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:05,624
I don't know where.
It's a big thing, a warehouse!

816
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:09,628
Buckle up.
<i>You can't drive.</i>
<i>You don't have a license!</i>

817
01:17:09,629 --> 01:17:12,698
We're going in!
<i>What are you doing?</i>

818
01:17:12,699 --> 01:17:14,667
I don't know.
It's a--

819
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:21,273
Ted! Ted!

820
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:24,610
<i>ya-hoo!</i>

821
01:17:43,897 --> 01:17:46,065
Cool.
Dad!

822
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:48,100
<i>Dad!</i>

823
01:17:48,101 --> 01:17:49,802
Dad!

824
01:17:49,803 --> 01:17:52,738
Oh, my babies!
Are you all right?

825
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:56,041
Beethoven!
Beethoven!

826
01:17:56,042 --> 01:18:00,312
I love this dog.
What a good doggie!
<i>George!</i>

827
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:03,148
George!
Oh, my god!

828
01:18:03,149 --> 01:18:06,719
<i>Be careful!</i>

829
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,221
Is everyone alive?
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Where were you?</i>

830
01:18:09,222 --> 01:18:11,357
I was shopping, george!
I called the police.

831
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:14,793
I jumped through the thing,
I fell on the guys.
You're kidding?

832
01:18:14,794 --> 01:18:17,563
You let ted drive
through the door!
I didn't let him drive!

833
01:18:17,564 --> 01:18:20,366
Don't yell at me!
I'm not yelling.
Ahh!

834
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:23,602
<i>Oh, I love you too.</i>

835
01:18:23,603 --> 01:18:26,005
You're free!
You can go home!

836
01:18:26,006 --> 01:18:28,040
<i>you're free!</i>
<i>You're free!</i>

837
01:18:41,888 --> 01:18:44,123
Go, go!

838
01:18:44,124 --> 01:18:45,791
Sic 'em, boys!

839
01:19:09,683 --> 01:19:12,151
Help!
Get outta my way!

840
01:19:24,564 --> 01:19:26,598
Oh, my god!
Aaah!

841
01:19:26,599 --> 01:19:28,667
Out of my way!

842
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:39,078
Come on, harvey.
Over the fence.

843
01:19:52,492 --> 01:19:54,626
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

844
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:57,429
You thought you could get me,
you feebleminded mongrels!

845
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:01,700
- stupid, stupid doggies!
- never! You'll never get me!

846
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:08,307
Never!
Stupid, stupid doggies.

847
01:20:08,308 --> 01:20:10,476
Stupid, stupid doggies!

848
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:14,413
Stupid, stupid--

849
01:20:14,414 --> 01:20:16,148
<i>You little</i>
<i>mangy thing!</i>

850
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:18,017
<i>And you and you,</i>
<i>you little one!</i>

851
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:20,486
Never! Never!

852
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:22,554
You little mangy--

853
01:20:22,555 --> 01:20:25,090
What?

854
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:46,211
The final chapter of a horror
story for animal lovers...

855
01:20:46,212 --> 01:20:48,414
Concluded at
county courthouse today.

856
01:20:48,415 --> 01:20:51,316
- ruth walters has the details.
- animal lovers everywhere--

857
01:20:51,317 --> 01:20:53,986
Hey, it's us!

858
01:20:53,987 --> 01:20:58,123
...When dr. Varnick and
two associates were indicted
on 123 counts of animal abuse.

859
01:20:58,124 --> 01:21:01,160
Boo! Hiss!

860
01:21:01,161 --> 01:21:03,862
These were scientific
investigations!

861
01:21:03,863 --> 01:21:06,799
<i>...And leading the cheers were</i>
<i>the ring's unlikely captors,</i>

862
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,867
<i>The newton family</i>
<i>of valley vista.</i>

863
01:21:11,037 --> 01:21:13,605
I had no choice.

864
01:21:13,606 --> 01:21:17,910
Beethoven is not just some dog
that wandered in off the street.

865
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:21,613
He's a member of our family
and we love him very much.

866
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:23,582
<i>have you always been</i>
<i>a dog lover?</i>

867
01:21:25,652 --> 01:21:28,053
Ah--

868
01:21:28,054 --> 01:21:32,324
M-m-maybe
not as much as now.

869
01:21:32,325 --> 01:21:34,193
Thank you.

870
01:21:36,763 --> 01:21:39,732
This is ruth walters reporting
from county courthouse.

871
01:21:43,636 --> 01:21:46,071
Okay, guys.
Let's go to bed.

872
01:21:46,072 --> 01:21:49,074
Oh, do we have to?
It's been
a long day.

873
01:21:49,075 --> 01:21:53,112
You look beautiful.
Daddy, you're the best.

874
01:21:53,113 --> 01:21:55,881
Good night, dad.
I love you.
Good night, sweetheart.

875
01:21:55,882 --> 01:21:58,384
Say good night
to daddy.

876
01:21:58,385 --> 01:22:00,552
Can I stay up?

877
01:22:00,553 --> 01:22:02,788
You are up!

878
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:06,125
Go to sleep.

879
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,462
Hello? Yeah.

880
01:22:10,463 --> 01:22:13,332
Oh, ah,
hold on one second.

881
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:15,534
Ryce?
Who's calling?

882
01:22:15,535 --> 01:22:18,070
Ryce!

883
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:20,005
Don't stay on
too long?
Okay.

884
01:22:20,006 --> 01:22:22,207
Dad, who is it?

885
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:26,412
Somebody who saw you on tv,
mark something.

886
01:22:26,413 --> 01:22:29,314
mark.

887
01:22:29,315 --> 01:22:32,851
Hello?

888
01:22:32,852 --> 01:22:34,720
Yeah.

889
01:22:34,721 --> 01:22:36,855
No.

890
01:22:37,857 --> 01:22:40,893

Good night.

Sleep tight.

894

Good night, beethoven.

895
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:59,178
Good night, sparky.

896
01:22:59,179 --> 01:23:02,114
Good night, mitch.
Good night, murphy.

897
